## Question01 

Q: Explain more about "The `execute(&mut *txn)` instead of `execute(&mut txn)`. The dereferencing `&mut *txn` tells Rust to pass a mutable reference to the actual transaction, satisfying the trait bounds for Executor.", How does `*` could get reference

### Problem Context
Great question! Let's break down what happens when we use `*txn` and why it fixes the issue.

The error you're encountering occurs because Rust isn't recognizing that `&mut txn` implements the `Executor` trait, even though `Transaction<'_, Postgres>` does implement `Executor`. The issue is with how the `txn` (which is a mutable reference) is being passed to the `execute()` method.

### Why `*txn` Works

In Rust, `*txn` is dereferencing the `txn` variable, which is a mutable reference to a `Transaction<'_, Postgres>`. Let's walk through this step-by-step.

- `txn` is a mutable reference to a `Transaction<'_, Postgres>`, i.e., `&mut Transaction<'_, Postgres>`.
- `*txn` dereferences this mutable reference to give the actual `Transaction<'_, Postgres>` instance.

Now, when we use `&mut *txn`, we are doing the following:
- `*txn` gives us the actual `Transaction<'_, Postgres>`.
- `&mut *txn` turns that back into a mutable reference to the `Transaction<'_, Postgres>`. However, this time it’s no longer a reference to the reference but directly to the transaction.

To visualize it:

- `txn` is a `&mut Transaction<'_, Postgres>`. When you do `&mut txn`, you're passing a reference to the reference (`&mut &mut Transaction<'_, Postgres>`), which doesn’t match the expected type for `Executor<'_>`.
- `*txn` gives us the underlying `Transaction<'_, Postgres>`, and `&mut *txn` makes it into the expected `&mut Transaction<'_, Postgres>`.

### Why This Fixes the Problem

Rust needs an `&mut Transaction<'_, Postgres>` to satisfy the trait bound for `Executor`. However, when you try to pass `&mut txn` directly, it ends up being a reference to a reference, i.e., `&mut &mut Transaction<'_, Postgres>`. This is why the trait bound is not satisfied.

By using `&mut *txn`, you're explicitly telling Rust to:
1. Dereference the mutable reference (`*txn` gives you the actual `Transaction<'_, Postgres>`).
2. Take a mutable reference to that dereferenced value (`&mut *txn`), which is the correct type (`&mut Transaction<'_, Postgres>`).

### Summing It Up

- `txn` is a mutable reference: `&mut Transaction<'_, Postgres>`.
- `*txn` dereferences `txn`, giving the actual transaction: `Transaction<'_, Postgres>`.
- `&mut *txn` takes a new mutable reference to the dereferenced transaction: `&mut Transaction<'_, Postgres>`, which is what `execute()` expects.

This dereferencing pattern is necessary because Rust's borrow checker is strict about references, and `&mut txn` refers to a reference, which doesn't match the `Executor` trait. Dereferencing with `*txn` ensures you're passing the correct type.

## Question 02
Q: I define `let mut txn: Transaction<'_, Postgres> = conn.begin().await?;`, how txn is a mutable reference to a `Transaction<'_, Postgres>`, i.e., `&mut Transaction<'_, Postgres>`.

You're absolutely right to question this—let's clarify how `txn` behaves when defined as `Transaction<'_, Postgres>`. When you write:

```rust
let mut txn: Transaction<'_, Postgres> = conn.begin().await?;
```

Here’s what happens:
- **`txn`** is **not** a reference (`&mut Transaction<'_, Postgres>`), but an actual `Transaction<'_, Postgres>`. It is a mutable variable that holds a `Transaction<'_, Postgres>` value, which means you can modify the `txn` object directly (because it is mutable). In Rust, declaring `let mut` allows a variable to be mutable, but it doesn't mean it is a reference—it's a mutable binding.

In the earlier code, when you write `execute(&mut txn)`, you are passing a mutable reference to `txn`. Since `txn` is already a `Transaction<'_, Postgres>`, `&mut txn` is a mutable reference to that `Transaction`. The problem arises when the Rust compiler doesn't infer that this reference satisfies the `Executor` trait due to lifetimes or type inference issues.

### Why Dereferencing Works (`&mut *txn`)

Even though `txn` itself is not a reference, `&mut *txn` forces Rust to fully resolve the type by dereferencing it, and then passing a mutable reference. This is somewhat subtle, and though it might seem redundant (because `txn` is not a reference itself), it helps guide Rust's type inference in the right direction.

- `*txn` dereferences `txn`, but since `txn` is not a reference itself, `*txn` just gives us back the `Transaction<'_, Postgres>`.
- `&mut *txn` simply ensures that Rust treats it as a mutable reference (`&mut Transaction<'_, Postgres>`), which is required by the `Executor` trait for the `execute()` method.

This is why `&mut *txn` works: even though `txn` is a `Transaction<'_, Postgres>`, the dereference `*txn` gives the actual `Transaction<'_, Postgres>`, and `&mut *txn` is a valid mutable reference to that transaction. It’s effectively the same as passing `&mut txn`, but the dereference makes Rust’s type checker more explicit.

### Why Does This Matter?

In many cases, the compiler should infer that `&mut txn` is correct, but when the error happens, using `&mut *txn` ensures the compiler understands exactly what you're doing: taking a mutable reference to the `Transaction` object. It's a useful trick to handle subtle type and lifetime issues with Rust's strict type system.

### Summing Up:
- `txn` is a `Transaction<'_, Postgres>`, **not** a reference.
- `&mut txn` should normally work, as it passes a mutable reference to `txn`, but type inference issues can sometimes cause errors.
- Using `&mut *txn` ensures that Rust sees the reference to the actual `Transaction<'_, Postgres>`, resolving the `Executor` trait error by making the dereferencing explicit.
